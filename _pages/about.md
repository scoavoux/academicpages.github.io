I am a sociologist of culture. I specialize in the study of audiences with an emphasis on social inequalities and on reception. Most of my work has been about either art museums or video games, but I have also studied literature, television audience and music consumption.

I currently work as a researcher at Orange Labs, at the SENSE lab (Sociology and Economics of Networks and Services). I graduated with a PhD from the École Normale Supérieure de Lyon and I have taught and/or done research at the University of Avignon, the École Normale Supérieure, and Paris-8 University.
